                From 3G to 4G
            </h3>
            <h4>

            </h4>

            <p>
                When they announced 4G, people were not very excited. 
                They suggest that stepping into 4G will increase the 
                speed to load the video faster or other minor changes 
                like increasing of opening browsers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today we know that the 4G change completely changed everyone’s life. 
                People are more involve and invested in something virtual like social medias, 
                short videos (YouTube etc.) and online games. 
                In fact, these activities have become such an important part of our life now, 
                that we can no longer work or even communicate efficiently without them. 
                Take for example - WhatsApp, we base most casual communication on this, 
                using it daily and due to that we would rather leave a message behind then straight up calling the person (not polite to just call). 
                From cell phone calls to now asking to call by leaving a message, 
                our values and behaviours are changed with this “minor speed increase” people say before they saw the impact of it. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Video, audio and other file expected qualities are increased after 4G. 
                Thus, higher quality videos and audios has demand. 
                Purchasing games online is now an option since the buyer can purchase the game and install it within hours or minute depending on the game. 
                Purchasing physical products are more reliable. 
            </p>

            <p>
                New careers were created since the introduction to 4G like streamers, 
                youtubers and more action focused online games related careers (developers, E-Sport etc.).  
                These careers were not possible without the speed that 4G provided. And these careers are big not, 
                job that earn barely anything.
            </p>

            <p>
                Learning something has never been easier, due to accessibility of internet. 
                It is easy to try something new with the guideline of a video of someone doing it.
                 It is extremely easy to share and upload these knowledges in forms of texts, audios and videos. 
            </p>

            <p>
                All of these is part of our life, experiencing losing these temporally shows how much these means to us. 
                If all of us would drop the speed to the 3G age, life will be extremely inefficient and lots of people would not even be able to work.
            </p>

            <p>
                To sum it all up the advancement from 3G to 4G is not a “minor speed increase” rather it is a revolution, a game changer, one that sets new standards in both ever individual’s life and over all marketing.

                I am Kloma Yellow, a minor worshiper of the old one. 
                For the pass year or two, I can sense progress in the old one’s release. 
                This surely pleases the old one. However, the speed is not fast enough to unleash them within my lifetime. 
                It is a shame that I would not witness that day.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though my contribution is minor does not matter in the bigger picture,
                 but the great old one noticed me, I am the one of the chosen. I must do what I can.
            </p>

            <p>
                No one has managed to see what I truly do; 
                I would say my disguise is to a level that these ordinary humans will not recognize me. 
                With this page I now can recruit more to serve and to further release the old one. 
                This will also allow me to connect with the rest of worshipers, 
                and together we can surely make further progress and please the old one.

                Semantic markup is to make the website using relevant naming convention to what the author wants to present. 
                For example, when writing a block of text for each topic it should be in different articles using and in each of those there will be a heading then paragraphs.  
                This way each element provides meaning to the text, image or anything, such that the web page elements are easy to understand.
