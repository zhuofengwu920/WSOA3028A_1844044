                    Adobe announced that they are going end the support of Flash in the year 2020. This statement was made 3 years ago in July 2017. It is safe to say that Flash was an important part of the web. It is widely used and has a frustratingly long load time.

                    Back in the early 2000s if you were not a web developer you will most likely to think that Flash was a part of the browser or rather the web itself. It was extremely versatile, it can help getting videos online, animations and other interactive functionalities like mini-games. The success of the Flash is from its compatibility. In the early 2000s, it was difficult to get videos online since different browsers on a different operating system all interacted differently. However, with Flash installed it will load the content regardless of the browser or operating system.

                    The downside as I mentioned earlier, it often takes some time to load if not fail to load at all. The average bandwidth during that period was not helpful. Even then Flash still opened up a lot more options for web designers.

                    With newer standards such as HTML5 and WebGL, web developers move over to them rather than Flash. Since these can do what flash can but also able to be used in more platform like smartphones.

                    And now the year 2020, the web can do far more than the time of Flash. Flash has played an important row in the history of the web, but it is no longer up to the standards of the web. It is time for it to go.
