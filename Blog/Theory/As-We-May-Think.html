                In ‘as we may think’ written by Vannevar Bush, assumptions were made that technology and science should
                have a beneficial approach to humans rather than an aggressive or harmful approach. Which means that the
                regular lives of the people can be improved with the help of technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bush’s prediction focuses on capturing data as well as storing them. The predictions about photograph
                and the device ‘MEMEX’ are mostly true. Today's cameras have the versatility of the one mentioned in the
                article, making it easy to use and capable of capturing a more accurate and colorful image. The ‘MEMEX’
                is a device like the modern-day computer combine with the internet. The desk like feature such as
                recording information and having a keyboard to input data is achieved in the form of a computer, where
                its search and store large amount of data that can be shared or built in a trail is like the internet
                today.

            <p>
                Technologies in the article like the camera attached to the forehead and the bone conduction sound
                transfer device are invented in recent years
                (<a value="https://gopro.com/" href="#" class="otherSite">Go Pro</a>,
                <a value="https://vocalskull.com/" href="#" class="otherSite">Bone Conduction Glasses</a>)
                , though not perfected. With concepts like the ‘MEMEX’ and the point on inefficient information storage
                method they have then, inspiring the development of the web. This may be a good indication that some
                concept and device in the Bush’s prediction will come true in the future. Devices like the camera
                tracking and recording everything a person sees can be achieved by combining the eye tracker and a
                better storage solution (like a larger M2 SSD).

            <p>
                It can be said that Bush predicted what the information technologies will be like or it is that other
                scientist got inspirations from his article. Regardless of which ‘as we may think’ is a worthwhile piece
                to read.
