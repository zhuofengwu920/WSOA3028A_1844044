                    In ‘as we may think’ written by Vannevar Bush, assumptions were made that technology and science should have a beneficial approach to humans rather than an aggressive or harmful approach. Which means that the regular lives of the people can be improved with the help of technology.

                    Bush’s prediction focuses on capturing data as well as storing them. The predictions about photograph and the device ‘MEMEX’ are mostly true. Today's cameras have the versatility of the one mentioned in the article, making it easy to use and capable of capturing a more accurate and colorful image. The ‘MEMEX’ is a device like the modern-day computer combine with the internet. The desk like feature such as recording information and having a keyboard to input data is achieved in the form of a computer, where its search and store large amount of data that can be shared or built in a trail is like the internet today.

                    Technologies in the article like the camera attached to the forehead and the bone conduction sound transfer device are invented in recent years 
                    (<a href = "https://gopro.com/">Go Pro</a>, 
                    <a href = "https://vocalskull.com/">Bone Conduction Glasses</a>)
                    , though not perfected. With concepts like the ‘MEMEX’ and the point on inefficient information storage method they have then, inspiring the development of the web. This may be a good indication that some concept and device in the Bush’s prediction will come true in the future. Devices like the camera tracking and recording everything a person sees can be achieved by combining the eye tracker and a better storage solution (like a larger M2 SSD).

                    It can be said that Bush predicted what the information technologies will be like or it is that other scientist got inspirations from his article. Regardless of which ‘as we may think’ is a worthwhile piece to read.
