                The most noticeable concept in the podcast was the developers determines what the end product comes out
                of it. If the developer is not including all these differences in the world it will disadvantage some
                individuals. When people ignore issues and differences creates this inequality.

                This is getting to the point that people are so distracted and trust technology way more than they
                should. It results in them ignore things around them, their peers family. It is not to say the
                technology is bad, but it should be a tool that aids our activity and not determine them. And the
                concept of technology being trustworthy and fair is high flawed when we think about the creators of
                these are also humans. Often of productivity issue are ignore deliberately, in ways that the companies
                can make more profit.

                Some predict that we will have AI as judges since judges need to be rational and objective, and a
                computer can not be biased. On the surface this is scary and sounds logical, however, machines are not
                perfectly objective due to its creators. The fact that people can trust machines to that degree is
                concerning, which further show how disconnected people to people are today. People are almost controlled
                and skewed by technology and potentially its own and creator.
