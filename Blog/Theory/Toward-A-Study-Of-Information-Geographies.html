                The paper aims to show how important is information geographies, how it is skewed and justifications of
                it. <q cite='https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.8'>> Information has always
                    had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it
                    evolves and is transformed somewhere; </q>, the paper shows that the geography of the information is
                not necessarily just pieces of information about certain locations, but rather the information about the
                information of a place. The information about a place is contributed by many people. The important parts
                of it are where are this information is from, who wrote them as well as the time for the information.
                For example, look at <cite> Figure 5 Average number of edits to Wikipedia by country of origin</cite> in
                the paper there are far fewer edits in the Southern Hemisphere compare to its counterpart. Which means
                the Northern Hemisphere are shaping the information for the majority of the world. This means the
                information about those place that has fewer contributions in edits are more likely to be outdated,
                wrong or skewed. Although paper shows this as a result of internet accessibility of different country,
                can never justify it. The paper predicts that will be better as the internet access of the less
                developed country becomes more accessible. But this is still a problem as the world perceives the less
                developed countries less accurately, and further disadvantages those who still need to catch up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The paper shows just how inaccessible internet is in some countries with <cite> Figure 2 Cost of
                    broadband as a percentage of average income</cite>. In the places, they have the most edits and
                contributions the cost to have internet are far lower compared to their earning. It is important that
                the figure showed the ratio between the cost and earning rather than the absolute value or price of
                having bandwidth. Since accessibility here direct links to how affordable it is. For some internet may
                just be a part of their lifestyle and common to have, but for some, it is more than their earnings
                making it impossible to have access to. In the middle African countries, internet costs are either same
                as their earnings or worse more than their earning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although accessibility is a big factor in the contribution of the information geography, more accessible
                does not guarantee information being correct and up to date. <cite>Figure 7 Distribution of internet
                    users and platforms and modes of participation</cite> shows that Asia is the one that has most
                internet user, near half of the world. However, when it comes to contributions in both git commits as
                well as wiki edits, it is about 17% with the Domain name being more or less the same. This could be a
                result of the language barrier since both git and wiki are mainly English focused as well as the fact
                that programming(major git users are programmers) language are almost all in English.
            </p>
            <p>
                The methodologies used in the paper was to see the accessibility of internet in the world, the
                proportion of information contributor to users and to the population, and placenames and Geonames.
            </p>
            <p>
                The accessibility is an important factor that was taken into account. Since the less internet the more
                it hard locks people from contributing on the internet. However, this does show that most underdeveloped
                countries have other countries filling the information, which in most cases are not favourable. This
                leads to wrong and skews information as mention previously. It also shows the digital divides between
                North America and Europe form the rest of the world. The divide is even worse when it is compared to
                Africa.
            </p>
            <p>

                The method used for the contributors are not as precise do to language barriers across the world. Git,
                Wiki and programming in general are very dependent on the user knowing the English language. That means
                for countries that don’t have English as their primary language, they would not have a high contribution
                rate, even though they could be if it was in their own language. Thus using this to measure may not be
                as precise as ones that include a lot more languages.
                Lastly the placenames in Geonames, this shows how populated and the proportion of internet user there
                is. For services like online delivery and banking, placenames are often required and in that way, it
                will be recorded. Thus this shows how often or populations of those areas per country on the <cite>
                    Figure 11 Distribution of placenames in GeoNames</cite>.
            </p>

                In the conclusion of the paper, the uneven information geographies of participation and access were
                stated and supported by the paper itself. The paper did provide a different view of the world’s
                information geographies, the impact of the digital divide has on the information on the internet. The
                conclusion of the paper suggests that the paper is a start of research on this topic and future work
                will be done to further investigate the cause of this divide and unevenness. With the aim to lesser the
                uneven, being more inclusive and fairer information geographies the paper sets that as the ultimate goal
                and providing the paper itself as parts of the evidence that these problems exist.
            </p>
            <p>

                The information presented in the paper points to the unjust information representing the world being
                almost controlled by these who yields greater contribution to geography. And leaves the information on
                the internet less trustworthy while giving an illusion that it is reliable. The paper would encourage
                people to see this problem that is previously unseen and ignored.
