                The library of Babel is a short novel written by Jorge Luis Borges. The writing describes a Library
                consist of many connected hexagon rooms with 5 bookshelves on each wall, each shelf containing 32 books,
                each book has 450 pages, each page holding 40 rows and each row made up of about 80 letters. (if you
                want to visualize it here is a link of a website simulating this

            </p>

                It is said in the novel that it is infinite. However, using combinations where order does not matter, we
                can calculate by content how many books can there be in this setup. A book will contain 450(pages) x
                40(rows per page) x 80(letters per row) = 1,440,000 letters. Since the books are only combinations of 25
                different letters including full stops, comma and space, there can be 25 ^ 1,440,000 unique books in
                this library.
            </p>

            <p>
                25 ^ 1,440,000 does not seem to be too many compared with infinite but consider all atoms in the
                universe is estimated to be between 10^78 to 10^82, this number is huge. The number is so massive that
                it is difficult to even imagine. If one writes this number without the scientific notation, it won’t fit
                on all the paper ever produced.

            <p>
                That is an extensive number of books and the main character in the novel talks about how people in the
                library attempts to find specific books in the Library. Since the library is infinite or containing all
                combination of writing it must have a book that explains this library. But because it has so many it is
                also impossible to find. In the novel, some said that they can trace one book to another by finding
                similar contents, but from book A to book B to C to D … it goes through an infinite loop. Thus no one
                can ever find a book that can help them here.

                The novel is a reflection the author is trying to make on us human in comparison of the universe (the
                library). Where human fears the unknown, so they attempt to understand and justify the unknowns and the
                minute they cannot do that they feel alone and scared. So as the people in the novel, destroying
                so-called ‘irrelevant’ books even though that is so minuscule compare to the library. At the end of the
                short novel, the main character speaks of the “elegant hope” of someone at the end of time will find
                that book and justify the library. This further shows that the only relief a tiny human can have facing
                the infinite universe is to hope someone in the everlasting of the universe will justify and understand
                it.
