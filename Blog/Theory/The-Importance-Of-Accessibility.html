                    Accessibility refers to the quality of being easy to use and easily understood. It also refers to making it useable and user friendly to everyone. For example, an instruction on the site such as button and functionality should be clearly stated rather than colour dependent (i.e. Just a green tab to confirm), as colour blind individuals can easily use and navigate the site. Other elements like font type and size should also be considered to improve the user interface.

                    Individuals like elderly people as well as the younger audience should also be considered. That is in terms of both functionalities of the site and the contents presented. Making buttons and interactable element clear and easy to identify is key. Feedback when they hover over the element, and when they interact with it. This has to be instant or fast enough to show them that they have interacted with this element.

                    There are also other reasons to make sites accessibility other than the ethical point of view. From a profit point of view, the more views of the site make the site more successful. If the site is not accessible to some individual, they are losing those potential customers. Whether it is hard to navigate or ambiguous instructions that throw people off and turning away from the site.

                    More and more country has started to put laws for standards of accessibilities. The goal of being accessible is to make things easy to understand and easy to use, ultimately not leaving anyone behind.
