                There is no doubt that Tik Tok is big right now, with more and more people’s time being in many smaller
                pieces rather than in fewer chunks. Tik Tok is an application that you can get on your phone. It is
                marketed as an app that can capture and share your creative moments. The app provides and allows you to
                make small short videos for you to then later share with other people. The app has systems similar to
                Facebook where it recommends possible friends(strangers) to you and allows you to follow them and to see
                their Tik Tok videos. Marc Faddoul discovered that the recommendation AI will recommend people that look
                similar to ones that you followed. This is a problem where after following one person or just your
                friend group, you will only find people that are like them. Never to see any other types of people. The
                types here strickly refers to their appearance. It essentially narrows the content you can see whether
                it be race, cloths, gender.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a big problem with this, the majority of people that are using Tik Tok are teens or young
                adults. These are the people that the application is limiting their content to what they want at first.
                Then only display these content to form a dead loop. There is no racial diversity due to the nature of
                the AI.
            </p>
            <p>

                This does not just prevent users to see more content, but unfair to the content creators. <q
                    cite=‘https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/tiktok-algorithim-racial-bias’> For
                    example, he said, if the most popular creators on a platform are white, and the app keeps
                    recommending other white creators, it makes it hard for creators of color to gain followers and
                    popularity — even if that's not the intention of the algorithm. </q> The racial problem is there
                even though this was not intentional.
            </p>
            <p>

                The Tik Tok developer does argue the recommendations are to the characteristic of the person that is
                followed rather than the appearance. For example, if you follow an artist there will be more artist
                recommendations. So it is not intended to create this unfair or racial bias.
            </p>
            <p>

                Lastly, this is not just a Tik Tok problem, it is to be found in any other social media. And although it
                is not intentional does not mean that it is acceptable.
