                    It is important to know that the information from the medium we choose to believe in may not be necessarily true. For example, the content that is provided to us such as the news is generally considered as true. But this may just be a one-sided view of the side that has control over the local news. The ways we send out information can be a part of the message we are sending. Say that a serious message is sent through Instagram, this information will be taken more lightly than the information that is sent by email or direct phone call. So choosing a different medium for different information is important. Making a joke in the news will not be funny but would rather cause panic since the information there are to be taken seriously.

                    During an argument, points that are from the web are generally taken more seriously than individuals that are in the argument. People today disregard things far too easily by the medium they believe in and will dismiss ideas without giving it a second thought. Even though that medium could be spreading false information.

                    Furthermore, the medium that information is delivered gives the information a layer of meaning. Movies they are generally stand-alone stories. Even with ones that are a continuation of another, it often caters for individuals that have never watched the previous movies. This is due to the movie industry having to cater for everyone to get more profit. Thus, results in bad quality or less what it could be if they focus only on the continuation of the story.

                    The medium is part of the message along with the content of it. The medium itself limits or even enhancing the message and the information.
