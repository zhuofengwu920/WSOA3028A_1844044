                External Dependencies are external libraries and frameworks that can be imported to hep in projects and
                reuse codes in these dependencies to improve the site overall. These external dependencies often help
                developers to develop their site with either more convenience or give the developers more power to
                create their site. The nature of reusing code in using these dependencies means developers will need to
                learn this library or frame to use it effectively. Since it is external, it may need to be updated and
                some even need to be purchased. It also adds loads to the load time of the site, since it will need to
                download the dependencies each time it is visited. So even though it does provide convenience and power,
                it also has its downsides.

                The goal was to create a simple looped animation of little humanoid figures to move in a region and not
                interact with each other, even though they may intersect with one another. The idea here was to reflect
                the relationships between people in a busy city like Johannesburg. People were shown in a minimalistic
                manner with different colours to show diversity, but not necessarily coherent in no interaction. The
                lifeless grey in the background is an attempt in both the representing the concrete cement city and the
                attitude to one another. This is then placed at the about section as part of how the character or the
                how I see Johannesburg. This will be placed at my about page to show some character.

                To achieve this the one dependency that was used is Popmotion.js. Popmotion is a JavaScript library that
                makes animating elements in the site easier and efficient. It was also fairly easy to learn the basics
                of this library.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way that was taken to make this animation was to alter images’ x and y screen space coordinate in a
                restrained space. The function will assign a random location within the restrained space then have the
                object to move towards there with an ease-in-out motion (to show they are travelling). Once that
                animation is completed it will call itself again, then form an everlasting random travelling motion of
                these images (people). This is then called for the number of times that images with the class person on
                the page.
            </p>

                Other libraries can do a similar thing, some even better in performance. For example, Anime.js.
                Popmotion.js for less powerful compared to Anime.js. However, Popmotion has the upper hand in how
                lightweight the library is. The larger the library the more load is placed on the load time. In this
                case, Popmotion can do just fine, due to how simple the animation that is wanted to implement. Thus for
                efficiency Popmotion was selected.

                The piece here is an attempt on a minimalistic representation or reflection of Johannesburg in a
                foreigner’s eye. Especially for a foreigner that has been in Johannesburg for a long time. For native
                here they may not see just how diverse the people here are, in terms of race, culture and religion. The
                other thing is the city feel, people care a lot less about each other. Avoid interactions unless it is
                absolutely necessary. In that case, It is called intersections here. Someone crossing with someone else
                but not a will to interact.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the significant characteristics view on Johannesburg for both through the character and me.
