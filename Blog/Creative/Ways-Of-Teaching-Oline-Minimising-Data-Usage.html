            <p>
                With the Covid-19 getting closer to us, the overall lifestyle in the whole world including South Africa
                is going to be changed to prevent the virus. Education will be much harder since most of us will be
                reminded of home. Thus the course will be forced either to be postponed or done online.
            </p>
            <p>
                There a few problems with online learning. With South Africa having relatively expensive internet cost,
                it means a good amount of us may not have internet access at home, data is fairly expensive as well.
                Thus ways of online teaching that reduces the data usage will be helpful.
            </p>
            <p>

                The most common way of online teaching is to have every student online with a webcam and simulate the
                classroom experience. First of all, a webcam is basically to have a stream on for the whole duration of
                the class which costs a huge amount of data and it is not feasible.
            </p>
            <p>

                However, a Google docs or another online document editor paired with an online audio software can do
                just fine without expending a large amount of data. It can be used on a phone more effectively and does
                not require a camera to be used. Downloading and uploading audio is pretty cheap in terms of data
                consumption.
            </p>
            <p>

                So an audio class with the aid of good slides will be more feasible than a webcam online class.
