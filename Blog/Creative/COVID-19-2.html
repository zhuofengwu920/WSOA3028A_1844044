            <p>
                It has been a month of this lockdown, I suppose I have adopted this lifestyle. Not the worst, no need to
                drive anywhere. Just really lack the motivation to work and getting paid less by my company. It is
                somewhat annoying, but there is nothing I can do about it. Everyone is struggling, I at less can still
                work at home getting some income.
            </p>

                On a side note, I have picked up a lot of game I use to play again. Never realise just how many games I
                have that I haven’t played. The Witcher 3 game I got a few years back at rage I haven’t even touch. It
                is one of those game you claim you play even if you haven’t.
            </p>

            <p>
                As expected everyone is at home, online games are growing again, since everyone has so much time.
