                Origami, basically making something with some paper by folding it, often without using glue or other
                material to attach paper to other paper.

                This played a huge part in my childhood, in my family there was not a lot of free money. The parents
                didn’t earn a lot, there are little to no toys around or at less no new ones. As the eldest one amongst
                my siblings knowing origami or making paper toys as we say then helped a lot. As I made more and got
                more advance with it the more I like it. Perhaps is the ability to turn the newspaper into something
                that everyone wanted brings my young self a sense of accomplishment.

                However, the place that I learn this may be surprising. I discovered a book that had a guide to making
                these paper toys, I remember it was a manga don’t remember what story it had but the last few pages are
                always a guide to make an origami something. Could a hat, sometime they can provide a longer and more
                complex guide on a more difficult origami. I used to try for hours to make one of these, and the result
                is often a failure. It could be that I didn’t understand the steps properly, but because the next step
                builds on that so naturally it didn’t work if I didn’t understand just 1 step. But more often the paper
                broke in steps, back then I thought I was just doing it wrong. Only now I realise that newspapers are
                not the paper for origami.

                I was forced to stop this since I came to Joburg, the suitable paper are just hard to find here. I have
                been in countless art store and supplies here, and papers like tissue foil one of the more common
                origami paper are not to be found. This limited me in advancing and attempt more difficult origami. I
                still make some simple ones now and then but without challenging myself I find it difficult to be
                motivated to make some of these.

                It is frustrating to have your progress in something stop due to outside factors and not your
                commitment. It is like the world is trying to stop you for no good reason.
