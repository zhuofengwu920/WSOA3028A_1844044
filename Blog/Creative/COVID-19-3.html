                Nice. Today is a NICE day. It has been a while since I have been outside again. Now that the lockdown
                was downgraded to level 3, I am getting paid normally again. Still inconvenient to buy groceries and
                going outside in general. Certainly scared by the exponential growth of the cases of COVID-19 in Joburg.

                I have started a habit of play games again, just couldnâ€™t drop it when I had to go back to work. Will
                have to say it is more fun to proactively playing a game than falling asleep in front of a movie. I
                suppose it is the only good thing that COVID has brought.

                Huh, I have never felt so connected again to people. It is odd since there are less physical
                interactions. It is probably the games getting me talking to people again. I mean there is no need to
                have parties to socialise.
