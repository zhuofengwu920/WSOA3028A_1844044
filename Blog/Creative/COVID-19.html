            <p>
                Being an introvert is not a bad thing sometimes. This pandemic has little to no impact on me and has
                spared the pain of having to drive to work. Food gets delivered, I live alone so all seem to be good. It
                has made some free time since I do not need to drive for an hour to work.

                I started to pick up some games I never had time to play. And contacting some of my older friends I used
                to go to college with. I mean everyone is bored at home.

                So this is not as bad as I first thought it was (except I don’t get paid for this month). We will see
                how it goes…
