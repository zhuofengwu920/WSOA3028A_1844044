                    Semantic markup is to make the website using the relevant naming convention to what the author wants to present. For example, when writing a block of text for each topic it should be indifferent articles using article and in each of those, there will be a heading header then paragraphs p.  This way each element provides meaning to the text, image or anything, such that the web page elements are easy to understand.

                    Metadata should be included for the bots on the net to understand the site without the bot into the site. Say an English user search for a site on a search engine, all the site with a language = English metadata will show up. If the metadata does not specify the language, it may not deliver the site as easily for the ones that are searching for this kind of site.

                    The accessibility is also important. The accessibility here is about regardless of the device the user is using or any disability they can still view the site and understand its content. The more user friendly the better, since the goal is to allow more people to access the site. Things like viewing the site in colour blind mode to see if the site is still comfortable to view, if not the colour palette can be reconsidered. The font must be comfortable, using hard to read fonts may chase the user away in terms of hard to obtain information here or make the site seem unprofessional.
