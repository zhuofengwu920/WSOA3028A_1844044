                <p>
                    Hypertext is texts that extend to other information or text. Generally, hypertext contains links that take the user to other texts, either in an extension form, reference or related information. The web uses hypertext, with sites that are interconnected by hyperlinks. For example, when reading an article from a site, that site may have hyperlinks that take the reader to other related papers. Or technical words that are a hyperlink to a page that explain this word. Even a picture as a link to the source of this image.

                <p>
                    By using hypertext, the web is a far better place to obtain information. The writers may write exactly what they want and skip the basic explanation be leaving a link that explains those. When referring just include a link that takes the user to exact referenced phase, picture or anything that was referenced.

                <p>
                    With hyperlinks taking the user to different places a navigation system is often included in a website. It can be in the form of a navigation bar that is on top of the page. A search bar that allows faster access to specific contents. Sidebars show related items and related text. Without a navigation system, users will not be able to traverse the site then lose interest and leave. An efficient navigation system should be simple for anyone to use as well as making the destination clear. And use the shortest time to get to the page that the user wants.

                <p>
                    The structure of a site can show the character of the site. The way that a site is structured can make navigations easier. How pages are links, how they are categorised and how they show their information. If the pages of a site are linked well, then search engines can find the page easier and rank it high in the searching result. For example, the structure of a site should show what is the important pages of the site. Otherwise, it is going to compete with other pages on the same site in the search ranking.

                <p>
                    Regardless of the content of a website, just the structure itself can determine the how successful this site can be.
