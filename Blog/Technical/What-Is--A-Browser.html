                <p>
                    We use browser daily to look up information, see the news or watch a video and much more. Despite the frequent use of the browser, many still do not know what a browser is. A browser which is short for a Web Browser is a software that delivers and fetches information from the World Wide Web. That is its core functionality, modern day browser includes features like bookmarking websites and recording the history of site the user has been. However, light weight and text-based browser does exist, such as 
                    <a value = "https://lynx.browser.org/" href = "#" class ="otherSite">Lynx</a>.
                </p>
                    The browser works like the follow:
                    <ol>
                        <li>A user types the URL also known as the web address of the site they would like to view</li>
                        <li>The browser finds and connects to the DNS server then translates the URL to an IP address</li>
                        <li>With the IP address, the browser can connect to the desire siteâ€™s server</li>
                        <li>Then the browser will start a TCP connection with the server</li>
                        <li>The browser will then initiate the HTTP exchange (browser sends the server a request and wait for a response)</li>
                        <li>Once the server sends the display data, the browser will render those elements on the screen.</li>
                        <li>The HTML elements are loaded first</li>
                        <li>Then the CSS shapes the elements and colours them</li>
                        <li>JavaScript will be run depending on the actions or loading</li>
                        <li>At this point, the site is fully loaded</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                    That was a very simplified flow of how a browser works to load a site. All of these happens in seconds, with ones that have large bandwidth these are done in even less time. And all of these are to allow users to have a better experience on the web.
