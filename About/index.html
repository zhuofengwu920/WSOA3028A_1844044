                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Kloma welcom to my blog site. I write blogs about programming, web design and things that happen around me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently working in South Africa, Johannesburg as a web developer. I have started my first blog site a few months ago, yes the one you are looking at right now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have never felt comfortable around people from a young age. This is due to the unfriend treatment I receive ever since I came to South Africa at the age of 10. I do not know if it is the accent I have or the language barrier I had at the time, I was never able to fit in. Till today I have yet found myself to have an interest in events or activities that involves “large” amount of people (anything more than 10). This makes work extremely difficult. As a web developer, interactions with the clients are rather important, and this drains me. Not in the way that work is supposed to be tiring. Because regardless of how polite or nice a person is, the act of communicating with people drains me. This is why I choose to be a web developer rather than a designer, even if I liked the design aspect more. I tend to avoid teamwork or communication in general, and that has gotten worse in recent years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through the help of a friend, I have realised that I will need to do something to fix this. It is going to be difficult to start, and that friend of mine, in fact, one of the only few that I have suggested that I should start to communicate through cyberspace. It is far easier for me and can potentially reach more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is what encouraged me to start this site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A final note, I like to justify everything with some sort of reasoning, and I apologize if it gets annoying.
